# Response Services Incorporated - Miscellaneous

These code files have been inspired by scripts that I wrote to perform minor tasks while administrating the Google Drive (G-Suite) system at Response Services Incorporated. This is not meant to be a serious project. I was going through my backup files to see what I was able to clean up for public release.
