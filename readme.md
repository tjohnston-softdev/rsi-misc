# Response Services Incorporated - Miscellaneous
These code files are based on quick and dirty scripts I wrote to perform minor tasks while administrating the Google Drive system at Response Services Incorporated. This is not meant to be a serious project. I was going through my backup files to see what I should get rid of, archive, or clean up for public use.
